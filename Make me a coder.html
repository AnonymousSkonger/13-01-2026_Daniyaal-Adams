        <h2>Software Engineering</h2>
        <p>
            Software engineering is the discipline 
            of designing, developing, testing, and 
            maintaining software systems in a structured 
            and efficient way.
        </p>
        <p>
            It focuses on problem-solving, system design, 
            teamwork, and following best practices to 
            create reliable and scalable software solutions.
        </p>

        <h2>Python Programming</h2>
        <p>
            Python is a high-level programming language 
            known for its simplicity and readability. It 
            is widely used in web development, data science, 
            artificial intelligence, and automation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Python allows developers to focus on logic 
            rather than complex syntax, making it ideal for 
            beginners and professionals.
        </p>

        <h2>Web Development</h2>
        <p>
            Web development involves creating websites and 
            web applications that run in a browser. It 
            includes front-end and back-end development.
        </p>
        <p>
            HTML provides structure, CSS controls appearance, 
            and JavaScript adds interactivity. Together, 
            they form the foundation of the web.
